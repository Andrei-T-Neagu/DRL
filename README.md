# DRL_for_Stock_Trading
The goal of this project was to see if it is possible to implement a DQN model
using Transformers that can profitably trade a pair of stocks. Multiple different
methods were applied to the DQN agent to stabilize it as vanilla Q-Learning is
notoriously unstable due to it overestimating action values.

To run the code, simply use any .ipynb editor such as Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.

The project details are explained in the RL_Final_Project.pdf file.
